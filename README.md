⚙️ What Is Black Hole v21.8.4?

A high-speed encryption & error-correction engine built around three design pillars:

Core Feature	Description

⚛️ Quantum-Safe Security	Uses Kyber-768 (PQC standard) — resistant to quantum attacks
⚡ Zero-Copy Architecture	Eliminates redundant memory copies → 10× lower latency
🧬 Adaptive Multi-Layer FEC	Combines RS + LDPC + Tornado for 95%+ recovery under burst loss
🧠 Heterogeneous Compute Support	SYCL / Metal / ROCm abstraction for CPU–GPU hybrid pipelines


> AI-inspired, human-verified — adaptive FEC that balances speed and reliability dynamically.
